## Content Generation Process

### Step 1: Framework Deconstruction
Analyze the viral framework structure:
1. **Opening Mechanism**: How does it capture attention?
2. **Value Delivery Method**: How is information/entertainment provided?
3. **Engagement Strategy**: What drives interaction?
4. **Conclusion Approach**: How does it end memorably?

### Step 2: Original Concept Development
Create completely new content that:
1. **Follows the same structure** as the viral framework
2. **Addresses similar pain points** with fresh perspective  
3. **Uses new examples and statistics** (never copy originals)
4. **Delivers unique insights** within the framework

### Step 3: Platform Optimization
Adapt the content for target platform:
1. **Format Requirements**: Video, text, carousel, etc.
2. **Algorithm Optimization**: Platform-specific best practices
3. **Audience Behavior**: Platform-specific engagement patterns
4. **Technical Specs**: Character limits, video length, etc.
